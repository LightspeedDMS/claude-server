## Development Guidelines

- Going forward, you will always compile the code when you complete changes before you claim anything has been done. No code compilation success, you didn't achieve anything. You will not run the server, I run the server, you compile, you run tests, I run the server

## Code Quality

- No warnings in this project. Ever. Production code, tests. No warnings.
